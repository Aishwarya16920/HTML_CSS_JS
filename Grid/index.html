        Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China.
        These high bamboo forests are cool and wet—just as pandas like it.
        They may climb as high as 13,000 feet to feed on higher slopes in the summer season.
        Pandas are often seen eating in a relaxed sitting posture, with their hind legs stretched out before them.
        They may appear sedentary, but they are skilled tree-climbers and efficient swimmers.

        The koala is an iconic Australian animal.
        Often called the koala “bear,” this tree-climbing animal is a marsupial—a mammal with a pouch for the development of offspring.
        Though koalas look fuzzy, their hair is more like the coarse wool of a sheep.
        They have two opposing thumbs on their hands, and both their feet and hands have rough pads and claws to grab onto branches.
        They have two toes, fused together, on their feet, which they use to comb their fur.

        Polar bears live in one of the planet's coldest environments and depend on a thick coat of insulated fur, which covers a warming layer of fat.
        Fur even grows on the bottom of their paws, which protects against cold surfaces and provides a good grip on ice.
        The bear's stark white coat provides camouflage in surrounding snow and ice.
        But under their fur, polar bears have black skin—the better to soak in the sun's warming rays.

        The cheetah is the world's fastest land mammal.
        With acceleration that would leave most automobiles in the dust, a cheetah can go from 0 to 60 miles an hour in only three seconds.
        These big cats are quite nimble at high speed and can make quick and sudden turns in pursuit of prey.
        Before unleashing their speed, cheetahs use exceptionally keen eyesight to scan their grassland environment for signs of prey—especially antelope and hares.
        This big cat is a daylight hunter that benefits from stealthy movement and a distinctive spotted coat that allows it to blend easily into high, dry grasses.
        When the moment is right a cheetah will sprint after its quarry and attempt to knock it down.
        Such chases cost the hunter a tremendous amount of energy and are usually over in less than a minute.
        If successful, the cheetah will often drag its kill to a shady hiding place to protect it from opportunistic animals that sometimes steal a kill before the cheetah can eat.
        Cheetahs need only drink once every three to four days.
        Female cheetahs typically have a litter of three cubs and live with them for one and a half to two years.
        Young cubs spend their first year learning from their mother and practicing hunting techniques with playful games.
        Male cheetahs live alone or in small groups, often with their littermates.
        Most wild cheetahs are found in eastern and southwestern Africa.
        These populations are under pressure as the wide-open grasslands they favor are disappearing at the hands of human settlers.

       Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are renowned for their power and strength.
       Tigers live alone and aggressively scent-mark large territories to keep their rivals away.
       They are powerful nocturnal hunters that travel many miles to find buffalo, deer, wild pigs, and other large mammals.
       Tigers use their distinctive coats as camouflage (no two have exactly the same stripes).
       They lie in wait and creep close enough to attack their victims with a quick spring and a fatal pounce.
       A hungry tiger can eat as much as 60 pounds in one night, though they usually eat less.
       Despite their fearsome reputation, most tigers avoid humans; however, a few do become dangerous maneaters.
       These animals are often sick and unable to hunt normally, or live in an area where their traditional prey has vanished.
       Females give birth to litters of two to six cubs, which they raise with little or no help from the male.
       Cubs cannot hunt until they are 18 months old and remain with their mothers for two to three years, when they disperse to find their own territory.
