        <h1>Puppy</h1>
        <p>
          A puppy is a juvenile dog.
          Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg (1-3 lb), while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg (15-23 lb).
          All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth.
          A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier.
          Puppy refers specifically to young dogs.

      <h2>More Info</h2>
      Puppies develop very quickly during their first three months, particularly after their eyes and ears open and they are no longer completely dependent on their mother.
      Their coordination and strength improve, they spar with their littermates, and begin to explore the world outside the nest.
      They play wrestling, chase, dominance, and tug-of-war games.

    <h3>Fact-1:</h3>
    <p>You might expect puppies to be helpless when they’re born.
      (They’re babies, after all!) But did you know that they’re effectively born deaf and blind, with no teeth?
      It’s one of our favourite puppy facts!
      Even the famous canine sense of smell isn’t active when a puppy is born, and their eyes and ears are closed.
      Their eyes open when they are between 10 and 14 days old, with eyesight fully developing at about 7 weeks.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <h3>Fact-2:</h3>
    <p>Born without most of their senses fully developed, the first sense that puppies develop is touch.
       Almost from the very moment they are born, a puppy’s mother will lick and nuzzle them, stimulating their sense of touch.
       Touch continues to be important for your puppy throughout their lives.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <h3>Fact-3:</h3>
    <p>There are often many puppies in a litter, each genetically unique – but did you know that puppies can be twins?
      The first confirmed case of this was recorded in South Africa in 2016, with vet Kurt de Cramer delivering them via Caesarean section.
      Although it’s possible that there have been other unconfirmed cases of genetically identical canine twins, this was the first officially recorded instance of identical puppies being born.</p>

  <h3>More Info:</h3>
  <p>Everyone loves puppies, we know.
    It's scientifically proven that they're heart-meltingly cute.
    But there's more to the little fur babies than just those adorable puppy eyes.</p>

    <h3>Golden Retriever:</h3>
    <p>Goldens are athletic, strong and capable of carrying heavy game over land and water, using a broad, powerful head with strong neck and well-developed fore and hindquarters.
      The breed is slightly longer than tall, with a smooth, powerful, ground-covering gait, and dense, straight or wavy outer water-repellent coat.</p>
